Such an app should be readily available to journalists, be easy to use in multiple languages and be affordable or free. This app should not necessarily require a very expensive smartphone."

                "The challenges in the war zone are not easy, because you have to shoot and send photos and videos as soon as possible. You cannot film raids or bombings and send them after two days or more. The journalistâ€™s work also requires speed in sending news and materials to the department. Since internet facilities are not readily available, there should be some means to send stories and photographs online through some other (satellite?) system. There should be some system for a verified journalist to send information to a trusted recipient by bypassing the government-regulated internet lines, which - n any case - may have been blocked. This app should have the same level of security as an online bank account. This means a VERIFIED user (such as myself), verified recipients of my information, and strong safeguards so that if I am captured by the enemy there should be some automatic means to deactivate the account to prevent it being misused.."
